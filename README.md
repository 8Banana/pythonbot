# pythonbot

A simple IRC bot written in Python 3, using the curio concurrency library.

# Usage

This bot has two parts.

`ircbot.py` is a sort of library allowing you to write your own bot.  
All of the public methods are throughly documented.

`main.py` is a complete IRC bot that we, the #8banana team, use on our IRC
channel.  
You can use it on your channel by modifying the file itself.

We're very active coders, so it will probably be implemented/fixed rather
quickly.
